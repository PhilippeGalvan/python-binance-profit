# Welcome to python-binance-profit GitHub repository!
## Notes
The script allows you to place a buy order and automatically place an OCO order to secure your trade.
It's using the binance API python wrapper from @sammchardy [python-binance](https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance).
## Requirements
- Create an API key after logging in to your Binance account https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management:
  - Check both `Enable Reading` and `Enable Spot & Margin Trading`
  - Save carefully your `API key` and your `Secret key` (⚠️ the last one won't be visible again at your next login)
- Install Python 3.6+ (I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for instance)
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
## Use cases
